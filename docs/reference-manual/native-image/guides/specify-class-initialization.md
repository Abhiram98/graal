# Specify Class Initialization Explicitly

By default, Native Image initializes application classes at run time, except for the classes that Native Image proves "safe" for initialization at build time. 
However, you can influence the default behavior by specifying the classes to be build-time or run-time initialized explicitly.
For that, there are two command-line options: `--initialize-at-build-time` and `--initialize-at-run-time`.
You can use these options to specify whole packages or individual classes.
For example, if you have the classes `p.C1`, `p.C2`, â€¦ ,`p.Cn`, you can specify that all the classes in the package `p` are to be initialized at build time by passing the following option to `native-image`:
```shell
--initialize-at-build-time=p
```
If you want only class `C1` in package `p` to be initialized at runtime, use:
```shell
--initialize-at-run-time=p.C1
```

The whole class hierarchy can be initialized at build time by passing `--initialize-at-build-time` on the command line.

You can also programmatically specify Class initialization using the [`RuntimeClassInitialization` class](https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/sdk/src/org.graalvm.nativeimage/src/org/graalvm/nativeimage/hosted/RuntimeClassInitialization.java) from the [Native Image Feature interface](https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/sdk/src/org.graalvm.nativeimage/src/org/graalvm/nativeimage/hosted/Feature.java).

This guide demonstrates how to build a native executable by running the class initializer at run time, and then at build time, and compares the two approaches. 

## Run a Demo

For the demo part, you will run a simple XML SAX parser Java application, listing top five most viewed Java talks in 2023. 
The Java SAX parser is event-based, and does not load a complete XML document into memory, but reads it sequentially, unlike a DOM parser.

### Prerequisite 
Make sure you have installed a GraalVM JDK.
The easiest way to get started is with [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/jdks#graal).
For other installation options, visit the [Downloads section](https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/).

1. Save the following Java source code in a file named _SaxXMLParser.java_:
    ```java
    import java.io.IOException;
    import java.io.StringReader;

    import javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilder;
    import javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory;
    import javax.xml.parsers.ParserConfigurationException;

    import org.w3c.dom.Document;
    import org.xml.sax.InputSource;
    import org.xml.sax.SAXException;

    public class SaxXMLParser {

        private static final Document document = parseXML("""
                        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
                        <talks>
                            <talk name="Asynchronous Programming in Java: Options to Choose from by Venkat Subramaniam"></talk>
                            <talk name="Anatomy of a Spring Boot App with Clean Architecture by Steve Pember"></talk>
                            <talk name="Java in the Cloud with GraalVM by Alina Yurenko"></talk>
                            <talk name="Bootiful Spring Boot 3 by Josh Long"></talk>
                            <talk name="Spring I/O 2023 - Keynote"></talk>
                        </talks>
                        """);

        private static Document parseXML(String xmlContents) {
            try {
                DocumentBuilderFactory factory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
                DocumentBuilder builder = factory.newDocumentBuilder();
                return builder.parse(new InputSource(new StringReader(xmlContents)));
            } catch (ParserConfigurationException | IOException | SAXException e) {
                throw new RuntimeException(e);
            }
        }

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Talks loaded via XML:");
            var nodeList = document.getElementsByTagName("talk");
            for (int i = 0; i < nodeList.getLength(); i++) {
                System.out.println("- " + nodeList.item(i).getAttributes().getNamedItem("name").getTextContent());
            }
        }
    }
    ```

2. Compile the application:
    ```bash
    javac SaxXMLParser.java
    ```
  
3. Build a native executable, running the class initializer at runtime:
    ```bash
    native-image --initialize-at-run-time=SaxXMLParser -o runtime-parser SaxXMLParser
    ```
    The `-o` option specifies the name for the output file. 
    If your Java project structure is different, make sure to pass necessary JAR file(s) on the classpath using `-cp <ClasspathForYourProject>`.

4. Run the application from a native executable and `time` the results:
    ```bash
    time ./runtime-parser
    ```
    On a machine with 16 GB of memory and 8 cores, you should see a result similar to:
    ```

    ./runtime-parser  0.00s user 0.01s system 44% cpu 0.021 total
    ```
    The application parses the XML data at runtime.

    Check the file size which should be 19M:
    ```
    du -sh runtime-parser
    ```

5.  Next, build a native executable initializing `SaxXMLParser` at build time, and providing a different name for the output file to differentiate from the previous build:
    ```bash
    native-image --initialize-at-build-time=SaxXMLParser -o buildtime-parser SaxXMLParser
    ```
    
6. Run the second executable and `time` the results for comparison:
    ```bash
    time ./buildtime-parser
    ```
    This time you should see something similar to this:
    ```

    - Spring I/O 2023 - Keynote
    ./buildtime-parser  0.00s user 0.00s system 43% cpu 0.019 total
    ```
    Check the file size which should decrease to 13M:
    ```
    du -sh buildtime-parser
    ```
    The file size change is due to the fact that Native Image runs the static initializer at build time, parsing the XML data, and saving only the object into the executable. 
    Another valuable criteria for analyzing such a small Java application performance is the number of instructions, which you can obtain using the [Linux `perf` profiler](../PerfProfiling.md).

    [insert a screenshot]

This guide demonstrated how you can influence the default `native-image` class initialization policy, and configure it to initialize a specific class at build time, depending on the use case. 
The other benefits of the build-time versus run-time initialization are described in [Class Initialization in Native Image](../ClassInitialization.md), but, in short, build-time initialization can significantly improve the application efficiency.
